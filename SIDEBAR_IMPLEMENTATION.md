# Mobile Sidebar Implementation

## Overview

This implementation adds a top-down menu (hamburger menu) to the mobile app that opens a sidebar when clicked, similar to the web version. The sidebar provides navigation between different screens and includes language selection functionality.

## Components Added

### 1. MobileSidebar.jsx
- **Location**: `src/components/MobileSidebar.jsx`
- **Purpose**: Main sidebar component with navigation items and language selector
- **Features**:
  - Animated slide-in/out effect
  - Navigation items with icons and colors
  - Language selector dropdown
  - Responsive design (80% of screen width, max 320px)

### 2. CustomHeader.jsx
- **Location**: `src/components/CustomHeader.jsx`
- **Purpose**: Custom header component with hamburger menu button
- **Features**:
  - Logo and title display
  - Hamburger menu button
  - Navigation to Dashboard on logo click

## How It Works

### Navigation Flow
1. User taps the hamburger menu (☰) in the header
2. Sidebar slides in from the left with smooth animation
3. User can navigate to different screens by tapping navigation items
4. Sidebar automatically closes when a navigation item is selected
5. User can also close sidebar by tapping the overlay or close button

### Navigation Items
The sidebar includes the following navigation items:
- **Dashboard** - Main dashboard screen
- **Create Meeting** - Meeting creation screen
- **Calendar** - Calendar view
- **Notes** - Notes and tasks
- **AI Chat** - AI chat interface
- **Settings** - App settings
- **API Settings** - API key management

### Language Support
- Language selector at the bottom of the sidebar
- Supports English and Spanish
- Language preference is saved to user preferences
- Dropdown menu for language selection

## Integration

### App.js Changes
The main `App.js` file has been updated to:
- Include sidebar state management
- Use custom header for all screens
- Handle language preferences
- Manage user data loading

### State Management
- `isSidebarOpen`: Controls sidebar visibility
- `language`: Current language setting
- `user`: Current user data

## Styling

### Color Scheme
- **Background**: Dark gray (`#1F2937`)
- **Active items**: Medium gray (`#374151`)
- **Text**: Light gray (`#D1D5DB`) / White (`#FFFFFF`)
- **Icons**: Color-coded for different sections

### Animations
- Spring animation for slide-in/out
- Smooth transitions for all interactive elements
- Native driver for optimal performance

## Usage

### For Developers
1. The sidebar is automatically available on all screens
2. No additional setup required for new screens
3. Navigation is handled through React Navigation
4. Language support is automatically included

### For Users
1. Tap the hamburger menu (☰) in the top-right corner
2. Select desired screen from the navigation menu
3. Use language selector to change app language
4. Tap outside sidebar or close button to dismiss

## Technical Details

### Dependencies Used
- `@expo/vector-icons` - For navigation icons
- `react-native` - Core React Native components
- `@react-navigation/native` - Navigation integration
- `framer-motion` - Animation support (if needed)

### Performance Considerations
- Uses native driver for animations
- Efficient re-rendering with proper state management
- Optimized for mobile performance

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the sidebar:
1. Add user profile section
2. Include quick actions/shortcuts
3. Add theme switching
4. Include notification badges
5. Add search functionality
6. Support for custom navigation items

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Sidebar not opening**: Check if `onMenuPress` is properly connected
2. **Navigation not working**: Verify screen names match React Navigation setup
3. **Language not changing**: Check user preferences API integration
4. **Animation issues**: Ensure native driver is enabled

### Debug Tips
- Check console for any import errors
- Verify all dependencies are installed
- Test on both iOS and Android
- Check React Navigation setup
