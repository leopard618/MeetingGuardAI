# ✅ Persistent Notification - IMPLEMENTED!

## 🎉 **What Was Just Added:**

I've successfully implemented the **persistent notification feature** you requested! This shows a permanent notification in your notification tray (like "Android System" in your screenshot) when the app is in the background.

## 📋 **Files Created/Modified:**

### **New Files:**
1. ✅ `src/services/PersistentNotificationService.js` - Core notification service
2. ✅ `src/hooks/usePersistentNotification.js` - React hook for auto-management

### **Modified Files:**
3. ✅ `App.js` - Added initialization
4. ✅ `src/pages/Dashboard.jsx` - Integrated with meeting tracking
5. ✅ `app.json` - Updated notification config

---

## 🎯 **How It Works:**

### **Automatic Behavior:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ User presses Home button (minimize app) │
│              ↓                          │
│ App goes to background                  │
│              ↓                          │
│ Persistent notification appears:        │
│                                         │
│  🔔 Meeting Guard - Active              │
│  Next: SDFW at 2:28 AM                 │
│  In 5 hours 30 minutes                 │
│                                         │
│              ↓                          │
│ Updates every 60 seconds automatically  │
│              ↓                          │
│ User taps notification                  │
│              ↓                          │
│ App opens to Dashboard                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting:**

### **Problem: Notification doesn't appear**

Settings → Apps → MeetingGuard → Notifications
Make sure "Show notifications" is ON
```

**Check 2: App is minimized (not closed)**
- Use Home button ✅
- Don't swipe from recent apps ❌

**Check 3: There's an upcoming meeting**
- Meeting must be in the future
- Check Dashboard shows the meeting

**Check 4: Console logs**
```
Look for: "📱 Showing persistent notification"
If missing, check for errors
```

### **Problem: Notification doesn't update**

**Solution:** The update happens every 60 seconds. Wait at least 1 minute to see changes.

### **Problem: Notification shows wrong time**

**Solution:** Make sure meeting date/time is correct in Dashboard.

### **Problem: Can dismiss notification**

**Note:** On some Android versions, the "sticky" flag may not work perfectly. This is an OS limitation. The notification will reappear if you minimize the app again.

## 🎯 **Next Steps:**

### **Immediate:**
1. ✅ Restart app
2. ✅ Sign in with Google
3. ✅ Create test meeting
4. ✅ Minimize and verify notification

### **For Production:**
1. ⚠️ **Fix Google Client Secret** (see `QUICK_START_TOKEN_FIX.md`)

2. ✅ Test with real meetings
3. ✅ Verify on physical device (if using emulator)
