## Technologies Used

- **React Native** - Mobile app framework
- **Expo** - Development platform and tools
- **React Navigation** - Navigation library
- **React Native Paper** - Material Design components
- **React Hook Form** - Form handling
- **Zod** - Schema validation
- **Expo Notifications** - Push notifications
- **Expo Calendar** - Calendar integration
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework with dark mode support

## Dark Mode

The app includes a comprehensive dark mode implementation with the following features:

- **Automatic Theme Detection**: The app automatically detects the user's system preference
- **Manual Toggle**: Users can manually switch between light and dark themes
- **Persistent Settings**: Theme preference is saved and restored on app restart
- **Consistent Styling**: All components are styled to support both themes
- **Accessibility**: Proper contrast ratios and readable text in both modes

### How to Use Dark Mode

1. **Settings Page**: Navigate to Settings → Theme to toggle between light and dark mode
2. **Header Toggle**: Use the theme toggle button in the app header
3. **Sidebar**: Access theme toggle from the mobile sidebar menu

### Theme Context

The app uses a React Context (`ThemeContext`) to manage theme state across all components. The context provides:

- `isDarkMode`: Boolean indicating current theme
- `toggleTheme`: Function to switch between themes
- Automatic persistence to localStorage
