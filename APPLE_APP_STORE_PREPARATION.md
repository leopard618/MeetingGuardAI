# üçé Apple App Store Preparation Guide for MeetingGuard AI

## üìã Current Status Assessment

### ‚úÖ **Already Ready:**
- **App Configuration**: iOS bundle identifier set (`com.meetingguard.ai`)
- **Permissions**: Proper iOS permission descriptions in `infoPlist`
- **Privacy Policy**: Comprehensive privacy policy implemented
- **Terms of Service**: Complete terms of service implemented
- **Assets**: App icons and splash screens present
- **EAS Configuration**: Project configured with EAS Build
- **Subscription System**: Stripe-based subscription system implemented

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical Issues to Address:**

## üö® **1. IN-APP PURCHASES COMPLIANCE (CRITICAL)**

**Current Issue**: Your app uses Stripe for subscriptions, but Apple requires ALL subscriptions to go through Apple's In-App Purchase system.

**Required Actions:**
1. **Implement Apple In-App Purchases**:
   - Replace Stripe checkout links with Apple's StoreKit
   - Create subscription products in App Store Connect
   - Implement StoreKit 2 for subscription management

2. **Update Subscription Flow**:
   - Remove external Stripe links
   - Use Apple's subscription management
   - Handle subscription status through Apple's system

3. **Pricing Strategy**:
   - Apple takes 30% commission (15% for subscriptions after first year)
   - Adjust your pricing to account for Apple's cut
   - Current prices: Pro $7.99/month, Premium $14.99/month
   - Consider: Pro $9.99/month, Premium $19.99/month

## üö® **2. APPLE DEVELOPER ACCOUNT SETUP**

**Required:**
1. **Apple Developer Program** ($99/year)
2. **App Store Connect Account**
