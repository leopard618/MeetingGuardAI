# ✅ Always-Visible Persistent Notification - IMPLEMENTED!

## 🎉 **What Changed:**

I've updated the persistent notification system to work **EXACTLY like "Android System"** in your screenshot:

### **NEW BEHAVIOR:**

✅ **Always visible** - Shows 24/7, never disappears  
✅ **Shows when app is running** - Visible even when using the app  
✅ **Shows when app is closed** - Stays in notification tray  
✅ **Shows with NO meetings** - Displays "No upcoming meetings"  
✅ **Shows with meetings** - Displays meeting countdown  
✅ **Cannot be dismissed** - Sticky notification (like Android System)  
✅ **Updates automatically** - Every 60 seconds
