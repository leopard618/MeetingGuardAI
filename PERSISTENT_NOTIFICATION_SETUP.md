# 🔔 Persistent Notification - Setup Complete!

## ✅ What I Fixed

Based on your drawing showing a **mini app icon with text** in the notification tray, I've implemented a persistent notification system that shows:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  🔔 Meeting Guard - Active              │
│  Next: [Meeting Title]                  │
│  In [Time Until Meeting]                │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

This notification will appear in the **Silent section** of your notification panel when you pull down from the top of your screen.

## 🔧 Changes Made

### 1. **Android Permissions** ✅
Added missing permissions to `AndroidManifest.xml`:
- `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` - Required for Android 13+
- `FOREGROUND_SERVICE` - For persistent notifications

### 2. **Enhanced Notification Service** ✅
Updated `PersistentNotificationService.js` to:
- **Always show notification** even when no meetings exist
- **Request permissions automatically** if not granted
- **Add detailed logging** for debugging
- **Show "No upcoming meetings" message** when no meetings scheduled

### 3. **Test Button Added** ✅
Added a test button in the Dashboard:
- Located below the "Test Global Alert" card
- Blue notification icon
- Click "TEST" to manually trigger the notification
- Shows success/error alerts

## 🚀 How to Test

### **Step 1: Rebuild the App**
Since we modified `AndroidManifest.xml`, you need to rebuild:

```bash
# Stop the current app in emulator (close it completely)

# Rebuild Android app
cd android
./gradlew clean
cd ..

# Run again
npx react-native run-android
```

### **Step 2: Grant Permissions**
When the app starts, it should ask for notification permissions:
1. Click **"Allow"** when prompted
2. If not prompted, go to: **Android Settings > Apps > Meeting Guard > Notifications** and enable them

### **Step 3: Test the Notification**

#### **Method 1: Use Test Button**
1. Open the app
2. Scroll down on Dashboard
3. Find the **"Test Persistent Notification"** card
4. Click **"TEST"** button
5. You should see: "Persistent notification shown! Pull down notification tray to see it."
6. **Pull down from top of screen** to see notification panel

#### **Method 2: Automatic (with meeting)**
1. Create a test meeting for later today
2. The notification should automatically appear showing:
   ```
   🔔 Meeting Guard - Active
   Next: [Your Meeting Name]
   In [Time until meeting]
   ```

#### **Method 3: Automatic (no meeting)**
If you have no meetings:
```
🔔 Meeting Guard - Active
No upcoming meetings
Tap to open app
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **"No notifications appear"**
1. **Check permissions:**
   - Settings > Apps > Meeting Guard > Notifications
   - Make sure all notification categories are enabled

2. **Rebuild the app:**
   ```bash
   cd android
   ./gradlew clean
   cd ..
   npx react-native run-android
   ```

3. **Check logs:**
   ```bash
   npx react-native log-android
   ```
   Look for lines starting with:
   - `🔔 [PersistentNotification]`
   - `✅ Persistent notification shown`

### **"Notification disappears when I swipe"**
- This shouldn't happen! The notification is marked as `sticky: true`
- If it does, check Android version (should be 8.0+)

### **"App crashes when I click TEST"**
1. Check console logs:
   ```bash
   npx react-native log-android
   ```
2. Look for error messages starting with `❌`
3. Make sure permissions were granted

### **"Notification doesn't update countdown"**
- The notification updates every 60 seconds automatically
- Check that the app is running (even in background)
- Check logs for update messages

## 💡 Understanding Your Drawing

Your drawing showed:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  ⭕ app icon  ──────────────    │  <- Notification area
│                                  │
│  TEXT                           │  <- Meeting info
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

This is **exactly** what the persistent notification does! It shows:
- **App Icon** (🔔 Meeting Guard icon)
- **Title** (Meeting Guard - Active)
- **Text** (Meeting information or "No upcoming meetings")

The notification appears in the **"Silent notifications"** section when you pull down the notification panel.

## 🔄 How It Works Automatically

The notification system is **already running**:

1. **On App Start:**
   - `PersistentNotificationService` initializes
   - Checks for upcoming meetings
   - Shows notification automatically

2. **On Meeting Change:**
   - Dashboard detects next meeting
   - Updates notification with new info
   - Countdown updates every minute

3. **When App Minimized:**
   - Notification stays visible
   - Keeps updating in background
   - Shows countdown until meeting

4. **When Meeting Passes:**
   - Updates to next meeting
   - Or shows "No upcoming meetings"

---

## 📞 Need Help?

If you still don't see notifications:

1. **Take a screenshot** of:
   - The Dashboard (showing the TEST button)
   - Android notification settings for the app
   - Any error messages

2. **Share console logs:**
   ```bash
   npx react-native log-android > logs.txt
   ```

3. **Check Android version:**
   - Settings > About Phone > Android version
   - Should be 8.0 or higher

---

You now have a **persistent notification** that:
- Shows your app icon (🔔) with meeting information
- Appears in the notification tray when you pull down
- Updates automatically with countdown
- Works just like WhatsApp/Telegram notifications
- Stays visible even when app is minimized
